# Lab 5 Report

Setup Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
Setup Fork the repository
The real deal Start the timer!
Log into ieng6
Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
Edit the code file to fix the failing test
Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)
